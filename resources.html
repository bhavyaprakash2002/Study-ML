        After you have gone through some basic approcahes of machine learning, you have got to know that it's a vast field! 
        Finding a resource that is suitable to you and is reliable is most important thing before starting your journey.
        First things first, you will never get a resource that covers each and every topic of ML. You will have to rely on different resources to learn different topics.     
      </p>
      <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead">When I started my journey in ML a year back, I was wandering here and there trying to find good tutors online, courses, etc. But, I don't want you guys to worrry about it much.
        So, I am sharing with you all the resources that I learnt from. I will be also providing some of the websites and youtube channels that I found to be useful in the journey.  
      </p>
      <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead">Note! These are my preferences, depending on the learners' style of learning and practicing one may find other tutors or websites to be more useful.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4">After hovering over the internet to understand what ML exactly is I got to visit this playlist by 'CodeWithHarry'.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">Not diving deeply into the complex parts of ML where you have to preprocess the data and extract features, this playlist will give you an essence of coding in ML.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">It teaches you about using 'Pandas', 'Numpy' and 'Matplotlib' libraries of Python to carry out some simple operations on data and finally how you are going to train your model! It's amazing to make your machine intelligent by writing a few lines of code.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">After this playlist you will be able to carry out the most basic and necessary things in a Machine Learning Pipeline.</p>

      <p class="lead mb-4">After having a hands-on experience about coding in ML, you can watch this amazing playlist by 'Codebasics'.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">This playlist welcomes you too an integral part of Data Science i.e. data preprocessing and applying various ML algos such as Linear Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees and many more!</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">We all know that preprocessing a data is very crucial as it may affect your model's performance. Keeping in mind this essential step, the playlist teaches you about outlier removal, one-hot encoding, PCA, feature engineering and many more!</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">After completing the playlist you are now well aware of how things work in this field and are ready to move towards Kaggle!</p>

      <p class="lead mb-4">'Krish Naik' remember the name guys.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">Till now you must be aware that ML algos carry some intersting mathematics behind them.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">The playlist by Krish sir focuses on mathematics behind algos that are being used.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">Yeah it's true that the mathematics is a bit hard or may be some of you find it interesting or complex. But, knowing the mathematics have two advantages:</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">1. You are unique in the crowd.</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">2. Knowing maths behind an algo will also leverage you too fine tune your algos easily or you may also create your own algos!</p>
      <p class="lead mb-4">Not all algos have been covered in the video. Again remiding you that you can't rely on only one source.</p>
